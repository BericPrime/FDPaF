- [ ] Testing of model & refinements.

## TASKS:

Done using Discord Chat Exporter:
*LINK*

Messages availible within Github reposity under Text Logs - Archives

### Format of text files - IN PROGRESS

Likely done with a custom python script - shouldn't be too difficult, but likely tedious.

### Fine tuning of AI model - IN PROGRESS

Likely done using Kaggle as an online cloud IDE. More research is needed for a final decison.

### Training of model

TBD

### Quantization & export

TBD

### Open testing of model - "Alpha Prototype"

Timeline TBD
Prototype model exported onto physical computer with text interface.

A download of the prototype model will be availible below once completed.

NOTE: *This is a school project, we are not experts, and mostly learning on the fly*
