[3/23/2024 11:26 PM] vsarca
normally I would equip my blaster and one shot the guy in the head...


[3/23/2024 11:26 PM] vsarca
or take a knife to the face and one shot the guy in the head


[3/23/2024 11:27 PM] vsarca
.
oh @dengus  btw what I didn't mention is every spot in the body is a different like message
like that spot was the liver, so the game actually follows human anatomy with damage
so shooting someone in the heart is better than shooting someone in the gut

[6/26/2024 1:52 AM] poushie
Ok so @tungstendioxide 
Basically 
Furina is getting a rerun I think. As well as a new character up: Skinwalker

The dnd references I sent you that one time were from other new character’s story quest

But for the actually important stuff on the lord front
We got a few answers to like two questions during the interlude quest. Bit older but there was a banger quest with Ancient Remuria (founded by Imperator Remus \:) )

Natlan is on the way, Fall 2024 by the yearly nation releases. Still at least one more region should be for Fontaine though in my Esus.


[6/26/2024 1:52 AM] poushie
Let me think if there’s anything more uhhhh


[6/26/2024 1:53 AM] poushie
@tungstendioxide 
But basically the new character is supposed to be one of these

Just replace the battery


[6/26/2024 1:59 AM] bericprime
i would


[6/26/2024 2:01 AM] poushie
But basically in Remuria a long time ago there was Some random god named Remus who had a dream to make a perfect world free from the shackles of Fortuna (Fate, idk they also referred to it as a symphony or a boat or something) and idk some other god was like “ok sure”
Badda Bing Badda Boom turn them into a harp, now you’ve got Phobos, a symphony to challenge Phobos and also act as chatgpt to figure out all the decisions for you…


[6/26/2024 2:03 AM] poushie
Fast forward a bit now you’ve got your empire up and running and to make your people even freer from Fortuna, use golden ichor and turn them into golems
Also you’ve got some people in charge like Dominus Boethius and Dominus Cassiodor
Also there’s a dragon there…


[6/26/2024 2:05 AM] poushie
Anyways things are going swimmingly and Dominus Boethius is off crushing the pathetic Fontainian barbarian menace, having a swimming exterminating all of those pesky lochfolk and lochknights and whoopsie those were some war crimes…


[6/26/2024 2:07 AM] poushie
So Remus realizes he done goofed and is like, “Hey Cassiodor I’m gonna sever you from that symphony so you can make some chill choices” and then he goes to Scylla and gives him a sheet of music that can destroy the symphony and return all of the. Remurians to normal people because war crimes are bad, kids…


[6/26/2024 2:08 AM] bulbusarues
MIRABEAU <3


[6/26/2024 2:09 AM] poushie
So Scylla goes to the Capitolium with an army of Vishaps to do the thing but then Boethius suddenly betrays them and imprisons Scylla ruining Remus’ entire plan

Also Remus is dead now



Also @Sam you do make a good point
