[7/25/2023 3:51 AM] bulbusarues
You haven‚Äôt seen shit yet


[7/25/2023 3:51 AM] bulbusarues
That‚Äôs barely sane


[7/25/2023 9:22 AM] lumisusii
You post a more sane one then so we can have an emoji


[7/25/2023 7:27 PM] gy4le

:hypersane:


[7/25/2023 8:44 PM] house_of_skies
For what?


[7/25/2023 8:45 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
because she said she was drawing its probably for art class or something, we had to the same thing

That‚Äôs an if


[7/26/2023 11:04 AM] gy4le
it's for university applications rip (thinking of going into art)


[7/26/2023 12:23 PM] lumisusii
Where?


[7/26/2023 12:24 PM] lumisusii
Art universities are pretty diverse in terms of value as far as I‚Äôm aware of


[7/26/2023 12:25 PM] kyandise
yeah, they are pretty diverse......


[7/26/2023 12:26 PM] kyandise
i do know there's a very good one in alberta somewhere.... alberta university of the arts or smt....?


[7/26/2023 12:26 PM] kyandise
my friend is planning on going there cause she's also interested in getting into art


[7/26/2023 12:26 PM] kyandise

left


[7/26/2023 12:46 PM] gy4le

[7/26/2023 12:50 PM] arkeii
She will finish what he started

[7/26/2023 1:25 PM] lumisusii
It could be an early draft you know


[7/26/2023 1:26 PM] house_of_skies
A year early?


[7/26/2023 1:26 PM] kyandise
ehhhhh i know some people who probably started on their portfolios in middle school-


[7/26/2023 1:26 PM] kyandise
art takes a long time-


[7/26/2023 1:26 PM] kyandise
QwQ


[7/26/2023 1:26 PM] kyandise
and a portfolio has, like, probably 20 or so pieces or smt


[7/26/2023 1:27 PM] kyandise
tbh, a portfolio is just you picking whichever pieces of art you did that you feel like looks the best and shows off your skill the most-


[7/26/2023 1:29 PM] house_of_skies
Aka stable diffusion


[7/26/2023 7:59 PM] gy4le
I gotta get a whole ton of pieces done


[7/26/2023 7:59 PM] gy4le
like


[7/26/2023 7:59 PM] gy4le
12 or soemthing


[7/26/2023 8:00 PM] gy4le
mhmhm


[7/26/2023 8:00 PM] gy4le
rip the issue is I honestly don't do all too much art tbh so-


[7/26/2023 8:00 PM] gy4le
I'm starting form scratch


[7/26/2023 8:00 PM] kyandise
oooooooooooooof


[7/26/2023 8:00 PM] gy4le
middle school??


[7/26/2023 8:01 PM] kyandise
yeah, like, late middle school tho


[7/26/2023 8:01 PM] kyandise
grade 8


[7/26/2023 8:01 PM] gy4le
that's good but like issue is they'll probs improve and like the art won't really get 2 be used


[7/26/2023 8:01 PM] kyandise
i have a friend whose been cultivating her portfolio on and off


[7/26/2023 8:01 PM] kyandise
yeeee trueeeee


[7/26/2023 8:01 PM] kyandise
but it's good to have many options


[7/26/2023 8:01 PM] kyandise
:D


[7/26/2023 8:01 PM] gy4le
:0


[7/26/2023 8:01 PM] gy4le
mhm yeah def


[7/26/2023 8:03 PM] gy4le
imean it'll probs take a year to finish all of my pieces so


[7/26/2023 8:03 PM] gy4le
bc some things im thinking of r kinda complicated


[7/26/2023 8:04 PM] gy4le
tbh I prolly should've started last year because I won't have too much time during school


[7/26/2023 8:05 PM] kyandise
ooooof


[7/26/2023 8:05 PM] kyandise
at least you have the summer to work on it...?


[7/26/2023 8:05 PM] gy4le
bfjsjd yeah


[7/26/2023 8:05 PM] kyandise
o0o like what?????? OwO


[7/26/2023 8:05 PM] gy4le
haven't completed anything yet though a H a


[7/26/2023 8:06 PM] gy4le
I'm thinking of applying to fashion design (yesnill probably end up starving under a bridge but that's ok) so some stuff related to that


[7/26/2023 8:06 PM] gy4le
also


[7/26/2023 8:06 PM] gy4le
huge paintings


[7/26/2023 8:06 PM] kyandise
o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o


[7/26/2023 8:06 PM] kyandise

[7/26/2023 8:06 PM] gy4le
mhmhm


[7/26/2023 8:06 PM] gy4le
I'm kinda bad at it tho ngl rip


[7/26/2023 8:06 PM] kyandise
damnnnnnnnnnn i could never-


[7/26/2023 8:07 PM] kyandise
i'm sure it isn't bad!!!


[7/26/2023 8:07 PM] kyandise
:D


[7/26/2023 8:07 PM] gy4le
I'm not sure I can either üò≠üò≠


[7/26/2023 8:07 PM] gy4le
I have it planned out but


[7/26/2023 8:07 PM] gy4le
it'll probably take me around 3 months to finish


[7/26/2023 8:07 PM] gy4le
and thats only for one


[7/26/2023 8:10 PM] kyandise
oh, damn-


[7/26/2023 8:10 PM] kyandise
how big is this canvas....?


[7/26/2023 8:10 PM] kyandise
O-O


[7/26/2023 8:10 PM] kyandise
like, 3 whole months as in 90 full days????????


[7/26/2023 8:11 PM] kyandise
(though i guess i'm not one to judge, i did just spend an entire week on a stupid sundress that should've taken a single day-)


[7/26/2023 8:15 PM] gy4le
ohoh not full days (imean like working around 6 hours per day)


[7/26/2023 8:16 PM] gy4le
Like aprind 40height 30 width ithink


[7/26/2023 8:16 PM] gy4le
(inches)


[7/26/2023 8:16 PM] kyandise
that is still a lot of work-


[7/26/2023 8:16 PM] kyandise
........................................................................................................


[7/26/2023 8:16 PM] kyandise
that is


[7/26/2023 8:16 PM] kyandise
like


[7/26/2023 8:17 PM] kyandise
an entire meter tall-


[7/26/2023 8:17 PM] kyandise
.....................


[7/26/2023 10:32 PM] gy4le
(inches)


[7/26/2023 10:33 PM] house_of_skies
what are you painting?


[7/26/2023 10:33 PM] house_of_skies
also what are they looking for?


[7/26/2023 10:33 PM] house_of_skies
art is subjective


[7/26/2023 10:33 PM] house_of_skies
how can they just go and say, yeah this is better?


[7/26/2023 10:50 PM] kyandise
okay, but, like, converting 40 inches to cm equals 101.6 cm, which is a meter tall


[7/26/2023 10:50 PM] kyandise
i think


[7/26/2023 10:50 PM] kyandise
100 cm is a meter... right.....?


[7/26/2023 10:50 PM] kyandise
.....


[7/26/2023 10:50 PM] kyandise
Q-Q


[7/26/2023 10:51 PM] kyandise
and that is precisely why i refuse to go into the creative industry


[7/26/2023 10:51 PM] kyandise
:D


[7/26/2023 10:51 PM] house_of_skies
this is why numbers


[7/26/2023 10:51 PM] house_of_skies
number make sense


[7/26/2023 10:51 PM] kyandise
i think they're probably gonna look for a wide range of different techniques or smt


[7/26/2023 10:51 PM] kyandise
i dunno


[7/26/2023 10:51 PM] house_of_skies
numbers cannot lie


[7/26/2023 10:51 PM] kyandise
so true


[7/26/2023 10:51 PM] house_of_skies
imean they can lie


[7/26/2023 10:51 PM] house_of_skies
but like


[7/26/2023 10:51 PM] house_of_skies
there is an undeniable solution


[7/26/2023 10:51 PM] kyandise
usually-


[7/26/2023 10:52 PM] kyandise
:D


[7/26/2023 10:52 PM] house_of_skies
yeah


[7/26/2023 10:52 PM] house_of_skies
until you pull out the *j*


[7/26/2023 10:52 PM] kyandise
at the very least, there is a correct range where the solution should hypothetically be


[7/26/2023 10:52 PM] house_of_skies
cross over into the shadowrealm


[7/26/2023 10:52 PM] house_of_skies
and then sometimes you cant find your way out


[7/26/2023 10:53 PM] house_of_skies
yeah math do get a little quirky


[7/26/2023 10:53 PM] house_of_skies
do you know how they got like the justifications for the area and volume of shapes


[7/26/2023 10:54 PM] house_of_skies
from like 4th grade?


[7/26/2023 10:54 PM] house_of_skies
they pulled them out of the shadowrealm


[7/26/2023 10:54 PM] kyandise
........


[7/26/2023 10:54 PM] kyandise
:D


[7/26/2023 10:54 PM] kyandise
niceeee


[7/26/2023 10:54 PM] house_of_skies
im not even joking


[7/26/2023 10:54 PM] house_of_skies
mathemticians call it the shadowrealm


[7/26/2023 10:54 PM] house_of_skies
some of them


[7/26/2023 10:55 PM] house_of_skies
its *imaginary*


[7/26/2023 10:55 PM] house_of_skies
welcome to calculus


[7/26/2023 10:55 PM] kyandise
..... QwQ


[7/26/2023 10:55 PM] kyandise
i hate calc


[7/26/2023 10:55 PM] kyandise
calc is stupid


[7/26/2023 10:55 PM] kyandise
limits is just 'try everything until you find an answer'


[7/26/2023 10:55 PM] house_of_skies
yeah


[7/26/2023 10:55 PM] house_of_skies
integral is like


[7/26/2023 10:56 PM] house_of_skies
"and then you pull the trig idienties OUT OF YOU ASS"


[7/26/2023 10:56 PM] house_of_skies
cause this thing that never even contained pi has the solution of sin(x)cos(x^2)


[7/26/2023 10:57 PM] house_of_skies
also you have to go into the shadowrealm


[7/26/2023 10:57 PM] house_of_skies
sometimes


[7/26/2023 10:58 PM] house_of_skies
its literally like singing a dark pact


[7/26/2023 10:58 PM] house_of_skies
cause you introduce it


[7/26/2023 10:58 PM] house_of_skies
and if you cannot exterminate it


[7/26/2023 10:58 PM] house_of_skies
then you did fucked up


[7/26/2023 10:58 PM] kyandise
QwQ


[7/26/2023 10:58 PM] house_of_skies
oh yeah then theres 3-point infinity


[7/26/2023 10:59 PM] house_of_skies
where you have 3 diffrent infinities located at one point on a graph


[7/26/2023 10:59 PM] kyandise
.........................................


[7/26/2023 10:59 PM] house_of_skies
but thats more engineering


[7/26/2023 11:00 PM] kyandise
what kind?


[7/26/2023 11:00 PM] house_of_skies
electrical


[7/26/2023 11:00 PM] kyandise
oh, thank goodness


[7/26/2023 11:00 PM] kyandise
QWQ


[7/26/2023 11:00 PM] kyandise
no need to care about that then


[7/26/2023 11:00 PM] house_of_skies
yeah electrical gets a little quirky


[7/26/2023 11:00 PM] house_of_skies
REALLY QUIRKY


[7/26/2023 11:00 PM] kyandise
i pity all those who study electrical


[7/26/2023 11:00 PM] kyandise
that sounds like an absolute pain-


[7/26/2023 11:00 PM] house_of_skies
all of the vectors for any power source are in the shadowrealm


[7/26/2023 11:01 PM] house_of_skies
and dont even get me STARTED on AC


[7/26/2023 11:01 PM] house_of_skies
theres capactive reactance and inductive reactance


[7/26/2023 11:01 PM] house_of_skies
which are like calculus


[7/26/2023 11:01 PM] house_of_skies
but then they are also relative to time


[7/26/2023 11:02 PM] house_of_skies
cause they detrement a sine wave


[7/26/2023 11:02 PM] house_of_skies
and sine waves are funny


[7/26/2023 11:02 PM] house_of_skies
cause they are really fucking hard to make


[7/26/2023 11:02 PM] house_of_skies
with what is basically a switch


[7/26/2023 11:04 PM] kyandise
big oof

[7/26/2023 11:06 PM] house_of_skies
thats the graph


[7/26/2023 11:06 PM] house_of_skies
for ac


[7/26/2023 11:06 PM] house_of_skies
and whats that


[7/26/2023 11:06 PM] house_of_skies
radians


[7/26/2023 11:06 PM] house_of_skies
for capacatance?


[7/26/2023 11:07 PM] house_of_skies
also thats the 3 point infinity


[7/26/2023 11:07 PM] house_of_skies
and i think you can spin it?


[7/26/2023 11:07 PM] kyandise
.......................


[7/26/2023 11:07 PM] house_of_skies
it gets quirky


[7/26/2023 11:07 PM] kyandise
that looks like a portal to the underworld


[7/26/2023 11:07 PM] kyandise
:D


[7/26/2023 11:07 PM] house_of_skies
it looks like a spell to summon a demon
