[3/11/2025 8:13 PM] bericprime
for every football game you attend you lose one gay point


[3/11/2025 8:13 PM] the_baller47
Does school one count?

[3/11/2025 8:14 PM] bericprime
once you unlock though and make out with a dude you are perma-gay


[3/11/2025 8:14 PM] house_of_skies
It also means if you loose enough gay points to be below 5, your not gay
