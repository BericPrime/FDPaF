[Verse 1]
You say that we've got nothing in common
No common ground to start from
And we're falling apart
You'll say the world has come between us
Our lives have come between us
Still I know you just don't care

[Chorus]
And I said "What about Breakfast at Tiffany's?"
She said, "I think I remember that film
And as I recall, I think we both kinda liked it."
And I said "Well, that's the one thing we've got."

[Verse 2]
I see you - the only one who knew me
And now your eyes see through me
I guess I was wrong
So what now? It's plain to see we're over
And I hate when things are over
When so much is left undone

[Chorus]
And I said "What about Breakfast at Tiffany's?"
She said, "I think I remember that film
And as I recall, I think we both kinda liked it."
And I said "Well, that's the one thing we've got."

You are not head of robocup


[4/29/2023 10:32 AM] thesoupmasta
I‚Äôm joking lol


[4/29/2023 10:32 AM] thesoupmasta
I‚Äôm not joking about vex though it‚Äôs confirmed


[4/29/2023 10:32 AM] house_of_skies
Yeah that sounds about right


[4/29/2023 10:32 AM] house_of_skies
No one else does vex


[4/29/2023 10:32 AM] house_of_skies
Cause it sucks


[4/29/2023 10:33 AM] thesoupmasta
Lol


[4/29/2023 10:33 AM] thesoupmasta
Honestly if I‚Äôm head of vex something is seriously wrong


[4/29/2023 10:33 AM] thesoupmasta
This is my second year


[4/29/2023 10:34 AM] house_of_skies
yeah I don‚Äôt really see any 11‚Äôs doing vex


[4/29/2023 10:34 AM] thesoupmasta
There are 11s doing vex


[4/29/2023 10:34 AM] thesoupmasta
None were in team a or b


[4/29/2023 10:34 AM] thesoupmasta
So none actually had a working bot


[4/29/2023 10:34 AM] house_of_skies
It‚Äôs so restricted on what you can do


[4/29/2023 10:34 AM] thesoupmasta
Eh


[4/29/2023 10:35 AM] thesoupmasta
I guess that‚Äôs part of the gig


[4/29/2023 10:35 AM] thesoupmasta
You don‚Äôt get unlimited space to build stuff for use on like mars


[4/29/2023 10:35 AM] house_of_skies
Yea but you can‚Äôt do anything innovative really


[4/29/2023 10:35 AM] thesoupmasta
Yeah I guess


[4/29/2023 10:36 AM] thesoupmasta
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm also doing robocup


[4/29/2023 10:36 AM] thesoupmasta
Honestly it‚Äôs like this


[4/29/2023 10:36 AM] thesoupmasta
Either I can run code culture junior for first block next year


[4/29/2023 10:37 AM] thesoupmasta
Or I can do robocup


[4/29/2023 10:37 AM] house_of_skies
I could do robocup if I wanted


[4/29/2023 10:37 AM] thesoupmasta
And potentially run 2 AC pluses in grade 12


[4/29/2023 10:37 AM] thesoupmasta
Iykwis


[4/29/2023 10:37 AM] thesoupmasta
üòâ


[4/29/2023 10:37 AM] thesoupmasta
Our school hit such a dark spot


[4/29/2023 10:38 AM] thesoupmasta
For coding talent


[4/29/2023 10:38 AM] thesoupmasta
And engineering talent


[4/29/2023 10:38 AM] thesoupmasta
Everyone is like doing sports


[4/29/2023 10:38 AM] thesoupmasta
Our school sport teams were really good this year


[4/29/2023 10:38 AM] thesoupmasta
But robotics wise we suck


[4/29/2023 10:39 AM] house_of_skies
Yeah all the gr12‚Äôs are the only ones who do robotics


[4/29/2023 10:39 AM] thesoupmasta
Like I‚Äôm the last remaining member who can both code and build


[4/29/2023 10:40 AM] house_of_skies
Besides me


[4/29/2023 10:40 AM] thesoupmasta
At least this year we had Aaron and Bryan


[4/29/2023 10:40 AM] thesoupmasta
Do you code and build for vex?


[4/29/2023 10:40 AM] house_of_skies
Oh no


[4/29/2023 10:40 AM] thesoupmasta
Yeah


[4/29/2023 10:40 AM] house_of_skies
But I probably could


[4/29/2023 10:40 AM] house_of_skies
It‚Äôs not that complex


[4/29/2023 10:40 AM] thesoupmasta
Oh


[4/29/2023 10:40 AM] thesoupmasta
Ohh no


[4/29/2023 10:41 AM] thesoupmasta
It is actually a lot more complex than you think


[4/29/2023 10:41 AM] house_of_skies
The building is just rods


[4/29/2023 10:41 AM] thesoupmasta
I learned that the hard way this year


[4/29/2023 10:41 AM] house_of_skies
Building is easy


[4/29/2023 10:41 AM] house_of_skies
I mean


[4/29/2023 10:41 AM] thesoupmasta
It‚Äôs really hard to deal with vex components


[4/29/2023 10:41 AM] house_of_skies
Try designing anything


[4/29/2023 10:41 AM] thesoupmasta
The motors are really hard to deal with


[4/29/2023 10:41 AM] house_of_skies
Yeah


[4/29/2023 10:41 AM] thesoupmasta
Pneumatics is a ride to hell


[4/29/2023 10:41 AM] house_of_skies
They be like that


[4/29/2023 10:41 AM] thesoupmasta
And the brain


[4/29/2023 10:41 AM] house_of_skies
Ok I have to agree with that


[4/29/2023 10:41 AM] thesoupmasta
Coding on it is like teaching a monkey how to drive


[4/29/2023 10:42 AM] thesoupmasta
Motor overheats are real


[4/29/2023 10:42 AM] thesoupmasta
Underpowered motors


[4/29/2023 10:42 AM] thesoupmasta
Parts that have to be jerry rigged because vex doesn‚Äôt produce the parts we need


[4/29/2023 10:42 AM] house_of_skies
Yes well robocup you have to build the entire control system


[4/29/2023 10:42 AM] thesoupmasta
I know


[4/29/2023 10:42 AM] thesoupmasta
But at least you can build it to ur standards


[4/29/2023 10:43 AM] thesoupmasta
Vex is just jerry rigging together something working from a pile of flaming shit


[4/29/2023 10:43 AM] thesoupmasta
And trying to to accidentally set something on fire


[4/29/2023 10:43 AM] thesoupmasta
From the heat of the heavy duty tools we use


[4/29/2023 10:43 AM] thesoupmasta
Like at the hotel last year


[4/29/2023 10:43 AM] thesoupmasta
I was dremeling something


[4/29/2023 10:43 AM] thesoupmasta
And it got so hot


[4/29/2023 10:43 AM] thesoupmasta
It burned a hole through the hotel Capet


[4/29/2023 10:44 AM] thesoupmasta
Carpet


[4/29/2023 10:44 AM] house_of_skies
‚Ä¶


[4/29/2023 10:44 AM] thesoupmasta
And our mats


[4/29/2023 10:44 AM] house_of_skies
FDA?


[4/29/2023 10:44 AM] thesoupmasta
We had compressed air


[4/29/2023 10:44 AM] thesoupmasta
So when it started burning I quickly flipped the canister


[4/29/2023 10:44 AM] thesoupmasta
And applied some cryo fluid


[4/29/2023 10:44 AM] thesoupmasta
Prevented an actual fire


[4/29/2023 10:44 AM] thesoupmasta
Since polyester is flammable


[4/29/2023 10:45 AM] thesoupmasta
And the axle got so hot


[4/29/2023 10:45 AM] thesoupmasta
It started glowing red


[4/29/2023 10:45 AM] thesoupmasta
And it was made of steel


[4/29/2023 10:45 AM] house_of_skies
Yeah that sounds not fun


[4/29/2023 10:45 AM] thesoupmasta
Mhm


[4/29/2023 10:45 AM] thesoupmasta
Like I said


[4/29/2023 10:45 AM] thesoupmasta
Shitshow


[4/29/2023 10:45 AM] thesoupmasta
It gets worse


[4/29/2023 10:46 AM] thesoupmasta
Coding was a shitshow


[4/29/2023 10:46 AM] thesoupmasta
Vex PID is so bad


[4/29/2023 10:46 AM] thesoupmasta
We had to code our own


[4/29/2023 10:46 AM] thesoupmasta
Still the most complex engineering thing I‚Äôve down


[4/29/2023 10:46 AM] thesoupmasta
Done

it could be far worse

You are literally a mod as mod

Just a poor, suppressed one


[5/4/2023 10:38 AM] vsarca
oh ok


[5/4/2023 10:38 AM] vsarca
but


[5/4/2023 10:38 AM] vsarca
mods that use light mode can see better


[5/4/2023 11:19 AM] da_kitty
No, the light side is corrupt, join the sith, learn to save your loved ones, get cool yellow eyes


[5/5/2023 2:25 PM] house_of_skies
Yellow eyes r cool depending on what the pupil is


[5/7/2023 3:59 PM] house_of_skies
straight pupils and yellow eyes are sick


[5/7/2023 4:00 PM] house_of_skies
but circle pupils just look like palpitine


[5/7/2023 4:00 PM] house_of_skies
ew


[5/7/2023 4:00 PM] house_of_skies
and dont even get me started on rectangular pupils

[7/9/2023 12:55 PM] the_baller47
And add the new people


[7/9/2023 12:57 PM] bulbusarues
What if you told him to update it


[7/9/2023 12:57 PM] bulbusarues
And then killed yourself


[7/9/2023 12:57 PM] the_baller47
Then


[7/9/2023 12:57 PM] the_baller47
I would be dead


[7/9/2023 12:57 PM] the_baller47

Fuck you


[7/9/2023 1:02 PM] bulbusarues
Go ahead, try


[7/9/2023 1:03 PM] the_baller47
You don‚Äôt understand how much I don‚Äôt want to


[7/9/2023 1:03 PM] bulbusarues
So then don‚Äôt threaten it


[7/9/2023 1:03 PM] bulbusarues
Simple as


[7/9/2023 1:03 PM] the_baller47
The only reason I would touch most of you is to strangle you


[7/9/2023 1:04 PM] the_baller47
I would ensure English dosent feel me killing him


[7/9/2023 1:04 PM] the_baller47
I would use like a saw


[7/9/2023 1:04 PM] bulbusarues
He should suffer most


[7/9/2023 1:04 PM] the_baller47
Yes


[7/9/2023 1:04 PM] the_baller47
I agree


[7/9/2023 1:04 PM] bulbusarues
I don‚Äôt think you understand how to kill people painlessly


[7/9/2023 1:04 PM] the_baller47
But reasons


[7/9/2023 1:04 PM] the_baller47
The goal is I‚Äôm not killing him with my hands
