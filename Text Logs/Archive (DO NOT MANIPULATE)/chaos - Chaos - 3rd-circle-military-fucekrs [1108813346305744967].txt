[5/18/2023 9:55 PM] Reading Bot#4180
My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated.

Also back to our previous ~~argument~~ conversation


[5/21/2023 10:18 PM] lumisusii
When people talk about the T-34, they are referring to the T-34-76, the most famous variant


[5/21/2023 10:18 PM] lumisusii
Not both of them at the same time


[5/21/2023 10:19 PM] lumisusii
In the same sense, when people say Mosin, they are referring to one model


[5/21/2023 10:19 PM] lumisusii
Usually the M91/30 because that is the most well-known variant


[5/21/2023 10:20 PM] lumisusii
However, as its name implies, the M91/30 was a 1930 revision of the original M91 rifle


[5/21/2023 10:20 PM] lumisusii
They are not the same


[5/21/2023 10:20 PM] lumisusii

[5/21/2023 10:46 PM] yimyum_ch

[5/21/2023 10:46 PM] yimyum_ch
since it was used in soviet counterattacks against the germans


[5/21/2023 10:46 PM] lumisusii
Really? I found most T-34 medias circulating the 76


[5/21/2023 10:47 PM] lumisusii

OK


[5/26/2023 11:51 PM] bulbusarues
Anyways back to spitfires


[5/26/2023 11:51 PM] bulbusarues
While the Seafire FR 47 is pretty hot


[5/26/2023 11:51 PM] bulbusarues
We can’t take away from the value of griffon spits


[5/26/2023 11:51 PM] bulbusarues
Especially those painted in metallic colours


[5/26/2023 11:51 PM] bulbusarues
White or grey


[5/26/2023 11:52 PM] bulbusarues
They are one of if not the best representatives of the end of propeller driven fighters


[5/26/2023 11:52 PM] bulbusarues
For much the same reason as the Seafire


[5/26/2023 11:52 PM] bulbusarues
Given that the FR 47 was based off of griffon spits


[5/26/2023 11:53 PM] bulbusarues
The engine cowlings, the wings, the far back bubble cockpit, the cone shaped cannon mounts


[5/26/2023 11:53 PM] bulbusarues
It’s a beautiful plane


[5/26/2023 11:53 PM] bulbusarues
Not just an engineering masterpiece


[5/26/2023 11:53 PM] bulbusarues
But an artistic one too


[5/26/2023 11:53 PM] bulbusarues
I would probably let a griffon spit top me


[5/26/2023 11:54 PM] bulbusarues
Even more so if they’re painted in that beautiful metallic silvery grey


[5/26/2023 11:54 PM] bulbusarues
It’s such a sexy plane


[5/26/2023 11:54 PM] bulbusarues
Merlins are a bit different


[5/26/2023 11:54 PM] bulbusarues
Still fuckable


[5/26/2023 11:54 PM] bulbusarues
But it’s not a top


[5/26/2023 11:55 PM] bulbusarues
It doesn’t have that sense of sheer performance, the engineering and powerful shape


[5/26/2023 11:55 PM] bulbusarues
But it’s something else


[5/26/2023 11:55 PM] bulbusarues
Merlin spitfires have class, they’re elegant, smooth lines


[5/26/2023 11:55 PM] bulbusarues
Of course


[5/26/2023 11:56 PM] bulbusarues
Not to say the griffons and the FR 47 have no class


[5/26/2023 11:56 PM] bulbusarues
The merlins are just in a league of their own


[5/26/2023 11:56 PM] bulbusarues
They are what you think of when you hear spitfire


[5/26/2023 11:58 PM] bulbusarues
The razorback canopy


[5/26/2023 11:58 PM] bulbusarues
The classic spitfire look


[5/26/2023 11:58 PM] bulbusarues
And of course that short front end, housing the Merlin engine


[5/26/2023 11:59 PM] bulbusarues
You know how it flies the moment you look at it


[5/26/2023 11:59 PM] bulbusarues
It’s a master of aerobatics


[5/26/2023 11:59 PM] bulbusarues
Merlin spits are elegant and classy, like a flowing dance


[5/27/2023 12:00 AM] bulbusarues
Griffons are powerful and leave an impact


[5/27/2023 12:00 AM] bulbusarues
And the FR 47


[5/27/2023 12:00 AM] bulbusarues
Well she’s special


[5/27/2023 12:03 AM] bulbusarues
Like I’m not gonna lie (and this is going to sound deranged and insane) but if I had to refer to military equipment I would use feminine terms


[5/27/2023 12:03 AM] bulbusarues
So


[5/27/2023 12:03 AM] bulbusarues
On that note


[5/27/2023 12:03 AM] bulbusarues
If the spitfires were women


[5/27/2023 12:03 AM] bulbusarues
The griffons would be tomboys


[5/27/2023 12:03 AM] bulbusarues
The Merlins would be a classy and elegant lady


[5/27/2023 12:04 AM] bulbusarues
And the Seafire is that one that you are just drawn to for some reason


[5/27/2023 12:04 AM] bulbusarues
You can’t really explain it if someone asked


[5/27/2023 12:04 AM] bulbusarues
But on your own you can think of a list of 100 things


[5/27/2023 12:04 AM] bulbusarues
God I love the spitfires


[5/27/2023 12:04 AM] bulbusarues
They’re so sexy


[5/27/2023 12:05 AM] bulbusarues
Very few other series props come close


[5/27/2023 12:12 AM] bulbusarues
Now because I think of military equipment in feminine terms


[5/27/2023 12:12 AM] bulbusarues
There can be no femboy equipment


[5/27/2023 12:12 AM] bulbusarues
Which is quite sad


[5/27/2023 12:13 AM] bulbusarues
Anyways


[5/27/2023 12:17 AM] bulbusarues
But yeah I’m like 90% sure Griffon spots are a good representative of the tomboys of propeller driven aircraft


[5/27/2023 12:17 AM] bulbusarues
And well


[5/27/2023 12:17 AM] bulbusarues
I do love my tomboys


[5/27/2023 12:18 AM] bulbusarues
As Gyale so greatly put it once

Spitfires, one of few good things to come out of Britian


[5/27/2023 8:34 PM] bulbusarues
in my opinion, one of the, if not the, most beautiful propeller driven aircraft of the second world war


[5/27/2023 8:34 PM] bulbusarues
maybe ever


[5/27/2023 8:34 PM] bulbusarues
the Spitfire was not just an engineering marvel

it was an artistic masterpiece

The Supermarine Spitfire is a British single-seat fighter aircraft used by the Royal Air Force and other Allied countries before, during, and after World War II. Many variants of the Spitfire were built, from the Mk 1 to the Rolls-Royce Griffon-engined Mk 24 using several wing configurations and guns. It was the only British fighter produced con...

[5/27/2023 8:38 PM] bulbusarues
so generally, people separate spitfires into 2 sections, and further divide those sections up


[5/27/2023 8:38 PM] bulbusarues
the early Merlin spitfires, which were the most produced


[5/27/2023 8:39 PM] bulbusarues
and the late Griffon spitfire, which were some of the last piston fighters before the jet age arrived

woahhhhh coolll!!!!!


[5/27/2023 8:42 PM] bulbusarues
When someone says spitfire, they’re likely referring to the Merlins

Griffons are just called that

unlike the spitfire, there's not much I can perfectly pinpoint


[5/27/2023 9:24 PM] bulbusarues
no specific features which make it look good


[5/27/2023 9:24 PM] bulbusarues
its just that everything put together, the way it's put together, the shapes, the positions


[5/27/2023 9:24 PM] bulbusarues
its just perfect


[5/27/2023 9:25 PM] bulbusarues
there's no explanation I can give up the Centauros are simply stunning


[5/27/2023 9:25 PM] bulbusarues
I love them so much


[5/27/2023 9:25 PM] yimyum_ch

[5/27/2023 9:26 PM] bulbusarues

[5/27/2023 9:27 PM] bulbusarues
anyways, I feel the best way to describe a plane is to compare it to a shipgirl from AL

[5/27/2023 9:27 PM] bulbusarues
I would say that


[5/27/2023 9:27 PM] bulbusarues
the G.55s are like Roma


[5/27/2023 9:27 PM] bulbusarues
the first one I can think of


[5/27/2023 9:27 PM] bulbusarues
that's the connection I make immediately


[5/27/2023 9:27 PM] yimyum_ch
upgraded prototype of the ztz99


[5/27/2023 9:27 PM] bulbusarues
I love angular and orderly ERA


[5/27/2023 9:27 PM] yimyum_ch
Chinese main battle tank


[5/27/2023 9:27 PM] bulbusarues
straight lines, harsh angles, something that just screams danger


[5/27/2023 9:27 PM] yimyum_ch
the era makes it look almost like a western tank


[5/27/2023 9:27 PM] yimyum_ch
very angular


[5/27/2023 9:27 PM] bulbusarues
that's what a tank should be like


[5/27/2023 9:27 PM] yimyum_ch
bery nice


[5/27/2023 9:28 PM] yimyum_ch
mixes both the looks of east and west


[5/27/2023 9:28 PM] yimyum_ch
keeps a low profile like russian tanks


[5/27/2023 9:28 PM] yimyum_ch
but things like the size of the lfp and the thermal sight makes it look very nato-issued


[5/27/2023 9:28 PM] yimyum_ch
very hot


[5/27/2023 9:29 PM] yimyum_ch

if we're limiting it to ships and planes of the same nation


[5/27/2023 9:30 PM] bulbusarues
Merlin spits must be Hood


[5/27/2023 9:30 PM] bulbusarues
Griffon spits are like Ark Royal I'd say


[5/27/2023 9:31 PM] bulbusarues
and the FR 47


[5/27/2023 9:31 PM] bulbusarues
well


[5/27/2023 9:31 PM] bulbusarues
it might just be my biases


[5/27/2023 9:31 PM] house_of_skies
holy shit SHUT UP


[5/27/2023 9:31 PM] bulbusarues
but I'd say the FR 47 is a Warspite


[5/27/2023 9:31 PM] bulbusarues
but it doesn't really fit

you went for the weak insult


[5/27/2023 9:32 PM] bulbusarues
See right now I'd say the FR 47 is Warspite, but that's only because I love both of them dearly and I would kill to own a piece of an FR 47, a piece of Warspite, or a Warspite figure


[5/27/2023 9:32 PM] bulbusarues

ANYWAYS


[5/27/2023 9:34 PM] bulbusarues
on further thought, I'd say that the FR 47 is more like Swiftsure


[5/27/2023 9:34 PM] yimyum_ch
huh


[5/27/2023 9:34 PM] bulbusarues
elegant but powerful, and has an aura which just charms you the moment you see her

so does anyone know how one may qualify for a gun license in canada?


[5/29/2023 10:34 PM] kyandise
OwO


[5/29/2023 10:36 PM] bulbusarues
I'd assume its the same process of training and handling lessons

[5/29/2023 10:37 PM] bulbusarues
https://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/firearms/minors


[5/29/2023 10:37 PM] bulbusarues
second is more relevant


[5/29/2023 10:38 PM] bulbusarues
if you know anyone who is gun trained you can use a firearm without a license

now, if only getting a pyrotechnician license would be as easy....


[5/29/2023 10:39 PM] bulbusarues
yeah


[5/29/2023 10:39 PM] bulbusarues
its fucking cheap


[5/29/2023 10:40 PM] bulbusarues
pay for the course


[5/29/2023 10:40 PM] bulbusarues
30 dollars for a 2 year license


[5/29/2023 10:40 PM] bulbusarues
however


[5/29/2023 10:40 PM] bulbusarues
you still can't own a firearm


[5/29/2023 10:40 PM] bulbusarues
must be borrowed


[5/29/2023 10:40 PM] bulbusarues
so I'd say stick to firing ranges, maybe save that gun license for when you're 18


[5/29/2023 10:40 PM] bulbusarues
I'll probably get it too


[5/29/2023 10:40 PM] bulbusarues

[5/29/2023 10:43 PM] kyandise
what kind of gun are you looking into???????


[5/29/2023 10:45 PM] bulbusarues
Probably just going to be for collection and occasional firing

[5/29/2023 10:46 PM] bulbusarues
Don’t think I’m making any money though


[5/29/2023 10:46 PM] bulbusarues
The plan rn is work at a minimum wage job and starve to death at 30


[5/29/2023 10:47 PM] kyandise

[5/30/2023 4:47 PM] bulbusarues
I don't think there's many planes with cockpit lighting this red


[5/30/2023 4:47 PM] bulbusarues
got the whole commie bloc looking at it


[5/30/2023 7:48 PM] bulbusarues
the B-52 as a plane is fine


[5/30/2023 7:48 PM] bulbusarues
but the B-52 is not based


[5/30/2023 7:48 PM] bulbusarues
it is cool


[5/30/2023 7:48 PM] bulbusarues
it do thing


[5/30/2023 7:48 PM] bulbusarues
but its also very cringe


[5/30/2023 7:48 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
at least you somewhat agree


[5/30/2023 7:48 PM] bulbusarues
no I hate the B-52 it still fucking sucks


[5/30/2023 7:49 PM] bulbusarues
there is


[5/30/2023 7:49 PM] bulbusarues
very little reason why the US is still using them


[5/30/2023 7:49 PM] bulbusarues
very little


[5/30/2023 7:49 PM] bulbusarues
everything the B-52 can do can be done by anything else


[5/30/2023 7:49 PM] bulbusarues
there's no fucking point of the B-52


[5/30/2023 7:50 PM] bulbusarues
all it is is a pile of maintenance and shitty deterrence


[5/30/2023 7:50 PM] bulbusarues
A bomber with a radar cross section that big


[5/30/2023 7:50 PM] bulbusarues
travelling at such low speeds


[5/30/2023 7:50 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
what do you mean, its a proven machine that is known to be reliable


[5/30/2023 7:50 PM] bulbusarues
is going to basically be completely fucking useless in war


[5/30/2023 7:51 PM] bulbusarues
and there are other aircraft which have been proven to be more reliable


[5/30/2023 7:51 PM] bulbusarues
there's no fucking point in keeping the B-52 around


[5/30/2023 7:51 PM] bulbusarues
yeah its funny


[5/30/2023 7:51 PM] bulbusarues
WW4 will be fought with B-52s and Tu-95s and that shit


[5/30/2023 7:51 PM] bulbusarues
but there's literally no point it should exist


[5/30/2023 7:51 PM] bulbusarues
its also ugly as fuck


[5/30/2023 7:51 PM] bulbusarues
like a soild


[5/30/2023 7:51 PM] bulbusarues
4/10


[5/30/2023 7:51 PM] bulbusarues
which is pretty low


[5/30/2023 7:52 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
id give it a 6/10


[5/30/2023 7:52 PM] bulbusarues
it's ugly as shit


[5/30/2023 7:52 PM] bulbusarues
the Tu-95 is better


[5/30/2023 7:52 PM] bulbusarues
actually scratch that both of them are equally as ugly


[5/30/2023 7:53 PM] bulbusarues
they're both dumb


[5/30/2023 7:53 PM] bulbusarues
stupid

yeah


[5/30/2023 7:53 PM] bulbusarues
solid 3


[5/30/2023 7:53 PM] bulbusarues
maybe a 4 is its a good angle


[5/30/2023 7:53 PM] bulbusarues
for the both of them


[5/30/2023 7:53 PM] bulbusarues
ugly ass MFs


[5/30/2023 7:54 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
the body of the Tu-95 is ok but the nose looks so weird

that thing looks like a bath toy


[5/30/2023 7:56 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
one of those chilrens pool toy things or something


[5/30/2023 7:56 PM] bulbusarues
yeah its dumb as shit but it has nuclear capabilites


[5/30/2023 7:57 PM] bulbusarues
which means that using the same metal and maintenance which goes into a B-52


[5/30/2023 7:57 PM] bulbusarues
we can just build like 10 Gannets for the same capabilites


[5/30/2023 7:57 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
they are on a totally different level as the b-52


[5/30/2023 7:58 PM] bulbusarues
it'd be a hell of a lot funnier


[5/30/2023 7:59 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
thats true


[5/30/2023 8:01 PM] bulbusarues
if we invested the total cost of all the F-35s the US has


[5/30/2023 8:01 PM] bulbusarues
which is


[5/30/2023 8:01 PM] bulbusarues
about 450


[5/30/2023 8:01 PM] bulbusarues
we could instead buy


[5/30/2023 8:01 PM] bulbusarues
20 thousand lancasters


[5/30/2023 8:02 PM] bulbusarues
so basically


[5/30/2023 8:02 PM] bulbusarues
we can pull a Dresden 2: Electric Boogaloo


[5/30/2023 8:05 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
i feel like 20k lancasters would do a whole lot of nothing


[5/30/2023 8:06 PM] bulbusarues
its 20 thousand fucking lancasters


[5/30/2023 8:06 PM] bulbusarues
what the hell are they going to do to a group of 20 thousand lancasters


[5/30/2023 8:07 PM] bulbusarues
if we spend money on some modernization


[5/30/2023 8:07 PM] bulbusarues
lets say


[5/30/2023 8:07 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
air-air missile


[5/30/2023 8:07 PM] bulbusarues
10 thousand lancasters with modernized avionics, additional payload capacity, and the ability to carry A2A missiles


[5/30/2023 8:07 PM] bulbusarues
that's still 20 thousand air to air missiles


[5/30/2023 8:07 PM] bulbusarues
minimum


[5/30/2023 8:08 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
could target their refueling spots


[5/30/2023 8:08 PM] bulbusarues
you get hit by an air to air missile in the F-35


[5/30/2023 8:08 PM] bulbusarues
that's equal to 44 lancasters


[5/30/2023 8:08 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
rip


[5/30/2023 8:08 PM] bulbusarues
1 missile vs 44 missiles spent


[5/30/2023 8:08 PM] bulbusarues
same cost


[5/30/2023 8:08 PM] bulbusarues
and the F-35 runs on magic fuel that can't be targeted????


[5/30/2023 8:09 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
yea 20k vs 435 is a bit much


[5/30/2023 8:09 PM] bulbusarues
a bit huh


[5/30/2023 8:09 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
but if an entire air force vs 20k lancasters the air force would probably win


[5/30/2023 8:09 PM] bulbusarues
how


[5/30/2023 8:09 PM] bulbusarues
other than the US air force and navy


[5/30/2023 8:10 PM] bulbusarues
which singular air force can stand up to 20 thousand lancasters


[5/30/2023 8:10 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
maybe china


[5/30/2023 8:10 PM] bulbusarues
????


[5/30/2023 8:10 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
russia we learned is helpless


[5/30/2023 8:10 PM] bulbusarues
I don't think you understand how hard it is to take down 20 thousand planes


[5/30/2023 8:10 PM] bulbusarues
even if they come in waves


[5/30/2023 8:11 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
oh


[5/30/2023 8:11 PM] bulbusarues
fuck you mean "oh"


[5/30/2023 8:11 PM] bulbusarues
assume the US uses all of its air bases


[5/30/2023 8:11 PM] bulbusarues
around the world


[5/30/2023 8:11 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
i dont have that much experience with this sort of stuff


[5/30/2023 8:12 PM] bulbusarues
and launch lancasters as quickly and efficiently as they can


[5/30/2023 8:12 PM] bulbusarues
all towards china


[5/30/2023 8:12 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
well yea thats pretty difficult to combat


[5/30/2023 8:12 PM] bulbusarues
difficult?


[5/30/2023 8:13 PM] bulbusarues
that shit's impossible


[5/30/2023 8:13 PM] bulbusarues
a perfect defense is impossible

The Original Spitfire Surprise Low Pass
The original low pass when a WW2 aircraft  buzzed the camera crew shooting the open of a documentary on the 60th Anniversary of the Spitfire we produced for American television.

Despite hearing on the radio from the control tower that the Spitfire was rolling we couldn't see the aircraft against the sky and thought the presenter's link would be...

new ukranian wonder weapon just dropped


[6/6/2023 11:36 PM] lumisusii
During the Korean war PVA troops swarmed down the mountainside numbered in the ten thousands with fifteen rounds of 7.62 ammo each for their mosin nagant carbines (inaccurate for most part) and outdated m24 Mausers


[6/6/2023 11:37 PM] lumisusii
The better equiped US troopers with semi auto garamds, the newsest machine guns,  mortars and tanks couldn’t take them down


[6/6/2023 11:37 PM] lumisusii
Airstrikes, strafing, incendiary bombs all failed to take them down


[6/6/2023 11:38 PM] lumisusii

Battle of Chosin Reservoir
The Battle of Chosin Reservoir, also known as the Chosin Reservoir Campaign or the Battle of Lake Changjin (Korean: 장진호 전투; Hanja: 長津湖戰鬪; RR: Jangjinho jeontu; MR: Changjinho chŏnt'u), was an important battle in the Korean War. The name "Chosin" is derived from the Japanese pronunciation "Chōshin", instead of the Korean pronunciation.The battle ...

Go into the ‘battle’ subsection


[6/7/2023 12:18 AM] lumisusii
The marines were overrun, but after the PVA forces went into disarray, they were able to counterattack


[6/7/2023 12:18 AM] lumisusii
The first PVA wave was the most devastating to the marine corps


[6/7/2023 12:19 AM] lumisusii
After the initial surprise attack, the fighting broke into a stalemate


[6/7/2023 12:20 AM] lumisusii
Which was eventually ended when the PVA ran out of people to spare


[6/7/2023 12:21 AM] lumisusii
The marine air force also rearmed by then, and the marines made a retreat down south


[6/7/2023 12:21 AM] lumisusii
The frost wave from Siberia helped the US forces too


[6/7/2023 12:22 AM] lumisusii
A battalion of PVA troops were lying in foxholes waiting to ambush the US forces, but froze to death due to the frost wave


[6/7/2023 12:23 AM] lumisusii
Heavier tanks were fielded after the initial attacks and stopped the PVA from pursuing


[6/7/2023 12:25 AM] lumisusii
After the initial attacks, the PVA realized that they spread their forces too far out due to severe underestimation of the size of the US forces, and the US forces cut through the PVA flankers with relative ease


[6/7/2023 12:28 AM] lumisusii
Although I did overlook the AA guns eh?


[6/7/2023 12:28 AM] lumisusii
Ah it’s fine I said machine guns not AA


[6/7/2023 12:28 AM] lumisusii
So technically I’m not wrong


[6/7/2023 12:33 AM] lumisusii
I feel obligated to specify: normally machine gun nests are more than capable of stopping advancing armies. However, armies charging down hills physically unable to stop or turn back is another matter.

Woahhhhh


[8/7/2023 1:47 AM] kyandise
How sharp is it?????


[8/7/2023 8:22 AM] lumisusii
Looks relatively well oiled, but there is a roll near the top. Nothing a good swordsmith can’t fix though. I’m no expert in Katana prices, but if I were to offer a buying price I’d say 600 CAD for the sword, plus another 1200 CAD due to it being a historical artifact.


[8/7/2023 8:24 AM] lumisusii
I think that if the sword’s proven to be old(er) it’ll cost more on the artifact side of things.


[8/7/2023 8:27 AM] lumisusii
@SCP-085 You expert. You appraise.


[8/7/2023 9:13 AM] carbon.tetrachloride

[8/8/2023 8:22 PM] kyandise
who knows? maybe the handle is, like, hollow on the inside or smt......?

Wanted to use the BL 15-inch Mk 1 (N) but nobody posted an internal cross section for it


[9/15/2023 12:17 AM] bulbusarues
Then I tried the Flak 88, surprisingly, nothing


[9/15/2023 12:17 AM] bulbusarues
It was like the equivalent of looking up a ship and only getting the AL version


[9/15/2023 12:17 AM] bulbusarues
But it was looking up a gun


[9/15/2023 12:17 AM] bulbusarues
And only getting models/images/shit


[9/15/2023 12:18 AM] bulbusarues
Not an internal cross section diagram


[9/15/2023 12:18 AM] bulbusarues
Then I tried the QF 3.7 AA


[9/15/2023 12:18 AM] bulbusarues
Nothing


[9/15/2023 12:18 AM] bulbusarues
Tried the 90/53 mod.39 and 41


[9/15/2023 12:18 AM] bulbusarues
Nothing
