Yes, well, if you want to learn the depressing and very, controversial to say the least, history and shit it would be nice to know I didn't have to learn everything for nothing.

It makes no difference to me whether or not you know it


[4/25/2023 6:47 PM] the_baller47
Some people would want to learn more about it


[4/25/2023 6:47 PM] da_kitty
Like honestly, why did I have to learn about the priest who thought he was Jesus but also led a revolution for the Metis, was put in a mental asylum but fought for human rights, and then write a fucking essay about whether or not he was good?


[4/25/2023 6:47 PM] da_kitty
