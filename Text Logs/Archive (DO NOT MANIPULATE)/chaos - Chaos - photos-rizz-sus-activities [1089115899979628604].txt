Eyesight: War Thunder
Hearing: loud ass music and war thunder
Smell: generally dull and according to other very poor
Taste: fine I guess, but apparently it‚Äôs much worse than others, since everything of a certain kind basically tastes the same to me
Touch: my sense of feel is apparently very dull and poor according to others

[5/21/2023 9:02 PM] house_of_skies
this is a more simple analogy


[5/21/2023 9:02 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
no thats an analogy if your brain is miswired


[5/21/2023 9:03 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
i dont even understand whats going on


[5/21/2023 9:03 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
nor do i want to


[5/21/2023 9:03 PM] house_of_skies
...


[5/21/2023 9:03 PM] house_of_skies
so the voltage is the person pushing the person


[5/21/2023 9:04 PM] house_of_skies
and the resistance is the person stopping the person from getting pushed


[5/21/2023 9:04 PM] house_of_skies
and the amprage is the person getting pushed


[5/21/2023 9:04 PM] house_of_skies
got it?


[5/21/2023 9:04 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
whats wrong with the pipe/dam analogy


[5/21/2023 9:04 PM] house_of_skies
nothing its just the other one is funnier

I should get Mr. Gate to show this in class to explain electricity. The his single diagram explains it better than most of his teaching.


[5/21/2023 9:06 PM] house_of_skies
yeah


[5/21/2023 9:06 PM] house_of_skies
imean its not a bad analogy


[5/21/2023 9:06 PM] the_baller47
Just sus as fuck


[5/21/2023 9:06 PM] house_of_skies
and people will pay ALOT more attention to it


[5/21/2023 9:07 PM] the_baller47
Oh true


[5/21/2023 9:07 PM] the_baller47
That‚Äôs a plus


[5/21/2023 9:07 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
if the entire class understands it than we stop the science class from happening and everyone gets transferred to reeducation class


[5/21/2023 9:07 PM] the_baller47
Although they might pay attention to the wrong parts


[5/21/2023 9:07 PM] house_of_skies
your the one in need of reeducation diego


[5/21/2023 9:07 PM] house_of_skies

[5/21/2023 9:07 PM] house_of_skies

[8/23/2023 10:36 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
Why not just walk into a barber and ask them what they think would look best on you, they are trained in this field and have lots more experience with hairstyles than average teenagers like us. You would get a much better opinion.


[8/23/2023 10:43 PM] yimyum_ch
i dont think they would care about what he looks like


[8/23/2023 10:45 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
idk my experience with barbers is that they are generally nice people and would give you advice on a hairstyle


[8/23/2023 10:49 PM] bulbusarues
^has clearly never been to an asian barber


[8/23/2023 10:53 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
I have not no, but why would I? im not asian and there arent many asian barbers near where I live.

( I was a very stupid grade 11)


[10/12/2023 9:42 PM] gy4le

Imagine stealing chems from innocent St Anne‚Äôs students. Tsk tsk, no more cancer for them I guess.

i dont think youd find pure phthalates in a school chem lab unless they are trying to kill their students


[10/15/2023 9:25 PM] carbon.tetrachloride

[10/17/2023 8:54 PM] da_kitty
nah bro, the sad thing is I don't think you would get dresscoded on casual dress day for that


[10/17/2023 8:54 PM] yimyum_ch
really?


[10/17/2023 8:54 PM] house_of_skies

jeans are too optimal in a zombie apocalpse not to wear

so i have an issue with that


[10/17/2023 10:11 PM] bulbusarues
false


[10/17/2023 10:11 PM] bericprime
show up wearing clothing that will slowly degrade with time (over a period of 4 hours or so), until it is no longer dress code acceptable


[10/17/2023 10:11 PM] bulbusarues
the most practical pants in a zombie apocolypes is clearly


[10/17/2023 10:11 PM] bulbusarues
fashion designer jeans made to be relatable to the working class but also so fucking ridiculous nobody buys them


[10/17/2023 10:12 PM] bericprime
in terms of ease to get for scratch and injury protection?


[10/17/2023 10:12 PM] bulbusarues
well


[10/17/2023 10:12 PM] bulbusarues
jean jockets are jhit

they writ eshit like "inspired by the struggles of the original jean users"


[10/17/2023 10:13 PM] bulbusarues
but they


[10/17/2023 10:13 PM] bulbusarues
are uncomfortably thick


[10/17/2023 10:13 PM] bulbusarues
because


[10/17/2023 10:13 PM] bericprime
what the fuck is the point of ripping them

"the discomfort is a statement to past struggle"

Neutralize

uhh no, you use an inert solvent (like a CFC) that will totally dissolve the polyester shirt and leave a totally safe liquid by-product that you just ignore/let evaporate

THE FUCKING AMERICUNTS KEEP SAYING ROMMEL‚ÄôS GREATEST RIVAL WAS PATTON


[10/18/2023 12:24 AM] bulbusarues
HELLO???


[10/18/2023 12:25 AM] bulbusarues
WHEN DID PATTON AND ROMMEL EVERY CONFRONT EACH OTHER???


[10/18/2023 12:25 AM] bulbusarues
THE ENTIRE SECOND HALF OF THE DESERT WAR???


[10/18/2023 12:25 AM] bulbusarues
DO THEY NOT TEACH THE FACT THAT ROMMEL SPENT 3 YEARS IN AFRICA???


[10/18/2023 12:25 AM] lumisusii
I mean Patton did fight Rommel at one point


[10/18/2023 12:26 AM] bulbusarues
Monty kicked his shit in at the end but before that they were confronting each other very often


[10/18/2023 12:26 AM] lumisusii
Relieving a murican commander who just got his arse handed to him by Rommel


[10/18/2023 12:26 AM] lumisusii
Exactly


[10/18/2023 12:26 AM] lumisusii
Patton was the third wheel


[10/18/2023 12:26 AM] lumisusii
Actually wait


[10/18/2023 12:27 AM] lumisusii
Did Patton ever face off directly against Rommel?


[10/18/2023 12:27 AM] lumisusii
I can‚Äôt remember


[10/18/2023 12:27 AM] lumisusii
@Mizook help


[10/18/2023 12:28 AM] bulbusarues
He didn‚Äôt


[10/18/2023 12:28 AM] bulbusarues
At all


[10/18/2023 12:28 AM] lumisusii
Cool


[10/18/2023 12:28 AM] bulbusarues
Patton wasn‚Äôt involved until past D-Day for the most part iirc


[10/18/2023 12:29 AM] bulbusarues
At which point Rommel was basically out of the war already


[10/18/2023 12:29 AM] bulbusarues
Yeah he did some fighting later on but he didn‚Äôt ever face off against Patton


[10/18/2023 12:30 AM] lumisusii
Apparently according to Wikipedia he took over a division in Tunisia and trained them, but was relocated before he fought


[10/18/2023 12:30 AM] bulbusarues
Lmao


[10/18/2023 12:30 AM] bulbusarues
So basically nothing


[10/18/2023 12:30 AM] lumisusii
Ye


[10/18/2023 12:30 AM] lumisusii
The commander that was relieved got his behind handed by Rommel on a silver platter


[10/18/2023 12:31 AM] bulbusarues
But the americunts keep claiming patton was Rommel‚Äôs biggest rival


[10/18/2023 12:31 AM] lumisusii
Patton was substituted by chadley


[10/18/2023 12:31 AM] bulbusarues
:hah144p:


[10/18/2023 12:31 AM] bulbusarues
Incredibly


[10/18/2023 12:31 AM] lumisusii
Really?


[10/18/2023 12:31 AM] bulbusarues
Yeah


[10/18/2023 12:31 AM] bulbusarues
While looking for the clip


[10/18/2023 12:31 AM] lumisusii
Don‚Äôt go on enough history forums to know about this


[10/18/2023 12:32 AM] bulbusarues
I saw that one GuP clip of Erwin giving Rommel and Monty as an example of rivals


[10/18/2023 12:32 AM] bulbusarues
And all the comments were like


[10/18/2023 12:32 AM] bulbusarues
‚ÄúPatton: am I a joke to you‚Äù


[10/18/2023 12:32 AM] lumisusii
He is


[10/18/2023 12:32 AM] bulbusarues
‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

[10/18/2023 12:33 AM] lumisusii
Like


[10/18/2023 12:33 AM] lumisusii
Oh Patton was famous, and so was Rommel


[10/18/2023 12:34 AM] lumisusii
Therefore Pattonust be his greatest rival


[10/18/2023 12:34 AM] lumisusii
Hurr durghh


[10/18/2023 12:34 AM] bulbusarues
Rommel spent a major part of the war against solely British commanders


[10/18/2023 12:34 AM] lumisusii
Cue the eagle screeches and gunfire


[10/18/2023 12:35 AM] bulbusarues
One time apparently Churchill kept firing the commander in North Africa


[10/18/2023 12:35 AM] lumisusii
No care! Murica FUCK YEAH


[10/18/2023 12:35 AM] bulbusarues
To the point where they ran out of commanders to send to nor the Africa


[10/18/2023 12:35 AM] lumisusii
Patton > everyone else!


[10/18/2023 12:35 AM] lumisusii
No care


[10/18/2023 12:35 AM] lumisusii
Murica numba one


[10/18/2023 12:35 AM] lumisusii
Hurrr


[10/18/2023 12:35 AM] bulbusarues
So they had to pull fucking *Cunningham* to defend against Rommel until they could find someone else

[10/18/2023 12:41 AM] bulbusarues
It‚Äôs true that the British called in Cunningham to provide battleship support for lack of artillery


[10/18/2023 12:41 AM] bulbusarues
I think


[10/18/2023 12:41 AM] bulbusarues
Sometime in 41


[10/18/2023 12:41 AM] bulbusarues

[10/18/2023 12:41 AM] bulbusarues
Why I was wrong about is


[10/18/2023 12:41 AM] bulbusarues
*it was the wrong cunningham*


[10/18/2023 12:41 AM] bulbusarues
It wasn‚Äôt


[10/18/2023 12:41 AM] bulbusarues
Andrew Cunningham

just to be clear i never actually explicitly said that


[10/23/2023 10:03 PM] da_kitty
yes, but we all know


[10/23/2023 10:10 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
no its just that its easier for classification


[10/23/2023 10:10 PM] carbon.tetrachloride

[10/23/2023 10:15 PM] yimyum_ch
bro


[10/23/2023 10:15 PM] yimyum_ch
colour does not classify sex

what they use it for gender reveals


[10/23/2023 10:16 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
i just copied what they did there


[10/23/2023 10:17 PM] yimyum_ch
you do not copy gender reveals


[10/23/2023 10:18 PM] yimyum_ch
those ppl set off pipebombs for a gender reveal


[10/23/2023 10:18 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
ok yea there safety practies dont exist but like when you need to label things for which gender they harm I usually colour code hazard symbols, what else do you do?

no, your fun is 5 yr old fun or 40 yr reactor technician fun, no in between


[10/30/2023 8:09 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
no I like alot of things everyone likes, if someone says to do something with them ill always do it with them. But the one thing I really dont like, is fake stories and games and characters that are based off them. I love PVP games/ sandbox games but i will not play a game thats based around or follows some kind of storyline or has some character personality background.  My disinterest in this topic makes me uninterested in a large group of the things this group in particular likes  a lot so it appears as there is little to no in-between.

[11/1/2023 9:36 PM] yimyum_ch
ikr


[11/1/2023 9:36 PM] the_baller47

[11/1/2023 9:36 PM] the_baller47
Kill yourself


[11/1/2023 9:37 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
thats what amazon alexas are for


[11/1/2023 9:37 PM] house_of_skies
:hah144p:


[11/1/2023 9:37 PM] the_baller47
you should too


[11/1/2023 9:37 PM] house_of_skies
i beat the shit out of that one when it went off at 3am


[11/1/2023 9:37 PM] the_baller47
bed frames are better


[11/1/2023 9:37 PM] the_baller47
the school ones are the best


[11/1/2023 9:37 PM] yimyum_ch
no


[11/1/2023 9:37 PM] yimyum_ch
bed frames fight back


[11/1/2023 9:37 PM] yimyum_ch
by enacting a normal force


[11/1/2023 9:38 PM] yimyum_ch
on ur fist


[11/1/2023 9:38 PM] the_baller47
yeah


[11/1/2023 9:38 PM] the_baller47
deal with it


[11/1/2023 9:38 PM] yimyum_ch
no


[11/1/2023 9:38 PM] house_of_skies
im pretty sure amazon alexas also have the normal force


[11/1/2023 9:38 PM] yimyum_ch
not when you throw it across the room


[11/1/2023 9:38 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
were like basically a suicide encouragement group at this point with how nuch we say kill yourself


[11/1/2023 9:38 PM] yimyum_ch
actually


[11/1/2023 9:38 PM] yimyum_ch

[11/1/2023 9:39 PM] yimyum_ch
ur inertia is greater


[11/1/2023 9:39 PM] yimyum_ch
so ylu dont get hurt


[11/1/2023 9:39 PM] yimyum_ch
whyle chucking the alexa across the room


[11/1/2023 9:39 PM] the_baller47
yes


[11/1/2023 9:39 PM] house_of_skies
...what?


[11/1/2023 9:40 PM] yimyum_ch
newton 3rd law or sum shit


[11/1/2023 9:40 PM] bericprime
it enacts a smaller accelration on you than you do on it due to your higher mass dumbass]


[11/1/2023 9:40 PM] yimyum_ch
when you throw the alexa


[11/1/2023 9:40 PM] bericprime
f = ma


[11/1/2023 9:40 PM] house_of_skies
but also your the one accelerating it


[11/1/2023 9:40 PM] bericprime
f/m = a


[11/1/2023 9:40 PM] house_of_skies
slowly


[11/1/2023 9:40 PM] yimyum_ch
the force you enact on it is the same as the force it puts back on you


[11/1/2023 9:40 PM] bericprime
that means a higher mass decreases the accelartion for a same force


[11/1/2023 9:40 PM] house_of_skies
instead of a lot of energy quickly


[11/1/2023 9:41 PM] yimyum_ch
but inertia makes it so you dont throw yourself across the room

[11/2/2023 7:51 AM] bericprime
Meanwhile with Morrissey and chem I could have the jankiest steps and as long as I get the correct answer we good


[11/2/2023 7:51 AM] bericprime
Now, the issue here is:


[11/2/2023 7:51 AM] bericprime
My brain, is built like a hoarder‚Äôs bedroom


[11/2/2023 7:53 AM] bericprime
If I gain crap I throw it into the pile of garbage and if I need it then I shuffle myself over and dig while praying


[11/2/2023 7:54 AM] bericprime
The issue with this is now I have to somehow organize my thoughts (impossible) for physics


[11/2/2023 7:54 AM] bericprime
In the exact same way it‚Äôs Mr. Jamie Inglis


[11/2/2023 7:54 AM] bericprime
Bro how do you want me to do that


[11/2/2023 7:54 AM] bericprime
With magic


[11/2/2023 7:54 AM] bericprime
Crack?


[11/2/2023 7:55 AM] bericprime
Please father Inglis what do you require of me


[11/2/2023 8:13 AM] carbon.tetrachloride
For physics they expect like 3-4+ hours of studying a day it‚Äôs nuts and then In the end your still make mistakes


[11/2/2023 8:13 AM] carbon.tetrachloride
EXACTLY


[11/2/2023 8:14 AM] carbon.tetrachloride
And the physics teachers are so particular and picky about things like it has to be this exact certain way, even if you showed steps and got the right answer your steps weren‚Äôt the correct way to draw something or some crap and you get marks off


[11/2/2023 8:29 AM] da_kitty
Nah, just like a question or 2, so like 30 min-1 hour


[11/2/2023 8:29 AM] da_kitty
Bro comparing teachers instead of actual subjects


[11/2/2023 8:38 AM] bericprime
Then in their fucking questions the wording is so vague and sometimes they don‚Äôt even put in the right units


[11/2/2023 8:38 AM] bericprime
It makes me mad

Today at 6:00PM eastern time, I officially ended the production of chloroform. Its been in active production since 2020, and it ended today. Its kind of sad for me, but it has positive effects. 

Its very good environmentally, because the significant decrease in use of chloroform as a solvent will result in less emissions to atmosphere, as chloroform as a gas worsens ozone depletion over time. Stopping the production of it is a significant reduction in overall environmental impact.

see to avoid the sweat smell you need to get like very very cheap plastic/cellophane decorations because they absolutely reek of plastic and that overcomes the smell of alcohol and sweat.

so i looked it up and those things look to be made out of plastic/rubber or whatever right? so what you could do if you really needed to get rid of something that's like that, since obviously not everyone has access to solvents is immerse it in gasoline and it should dissolve, permitting its not made of HDPE.


[12/3/2023 9:49 AM] carbon.tetrachloride
oh yea and i forgot to add, you can then dump it down your sink while letting the tap run.

Crimes against god and/or the church

but like, why freeze it every time, instead, make it like a putty first, then it also takes less time to solidify and you can reshape it if you want a different style.

ok well everything I work with is an object, right so im used to just performing tasks based on pre-determined guidelines and not ever thinking about the implications of what im doing on a day-to-day basis unless im deliberately assessing that.

ohhh, i mean i could, but I tend to not affiliate or show support for any religious events or international causes with my companies operations. 
i decided that there isint a need to bring these celebrations or causes that people create into production activities because they serve no purpose here. Its not like i need to increase morale for workers. Its just basically not a place to express emotion or support for anything, its just a functional object that serves to fulfill its intended tasks and be used for business purposes.

[12/11/2023 7:49 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
imagine if your running a production plant and instead of like double checking and re-positioning vales your like "god will make sure its ok".  of course it wont be ok, and because you didn't re-set the valves the condenser was too hot and you deteriorated the air quality of an entire neighborhood. its just plain dangerous.

Well Kiribati has a population of 130,000 which means that they release 0.4 tons/person while you release 37800 tons/person, as you are only 1 person


[12/15/2023 2:08 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
well its not really for one person, since running a company thats producing and distributing products around the world. I guess that figure doesnt include the co2 emissions from all of amazons planes and trucks my products travel on, or the boats my nylon goes on to get to china.


[12/15/2023 2:20 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
my coal plant isint actually emitting nearly as much as the chemical plant, while i will only provide general emissions for the sas system as a whole to avoid providing information that targets a specific production plant, I will say that the chemical machines emitted less co2 than they did in 2022. so i am improving and im committed to reducing my machines environmental impact.

I didn't spend hours on calculations to determine the best atmospheric dispersion of pollutants and then spend thousands of dollars to construct not one but two 35 foot chimneys not to mention months of trials with air quality detectors to have my pollution affect me or my family.


[12/15/2023 6:56 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
here's an example of one such report, this was used to determine the environmental/human impact of the B100 C chimneys emissions. Significant amounts of planning and consideration went into a project of such a scale.

Like to operate this machine? It would require a lot of training and stuff, and I‚Äôd probably still have to be there in case something goes wrong. But to send all this waste to a company is difficult, because although I have a legitimate company, having tens of drums full of industrial chemical waste in your driveway to give to a company to pick up isint really a good look. It also costs thousands

and today I discovered this thing straight from hell, since i've been unpacking and processing chem waste one of the buckets which was shrink wrapped was this thing, so until I brought it into the machine and cut the plastic wrap off  I never knew what was under it since I packed them in 2021, and i forgot. Now realized I used this 5 year site a celebration bucket, and i used the 2014-2015 logo because i was like a retro thing or whatever i don't remember. And its a lowes canada bucket which is ig rare now since lowes canada doesnt exist anymore. i realized now it looks like the st annes logo from hell except i made it when i was 9 üíÄ  most def copied from somewhere though and i just changed the colour or something i dont remember, i didnt have this kind of graphic design skill.

I just dont understand how tf shes not dying of frostbite. Like when you spray on a coating that forms a protective layer the propellant (at least in my experience) makes the surface extremely cold. So she must be freezing to death rn or there doing something different.

[7/16/2024 3:11 AM] carbon.tetrachloride
back in 2021 there was a forest here.... now just over 3000 square feet of buried ash. the massive ash landfill you guys went aluminum digging in and I got radioactive ash from for physics finally closed after over 2 years operating. Alot of time and money went into this but its all properly cleaned up. This was by far the largest cleanup operation ive ever done, the area here was truly massive, imagine a piece of land the size of flavelle house. Thats how big this was and involved thousands of hours of work.

i feel like a 40 year old dad with this grass stuff but im absolutely over the moon right now that i got the grass to grow!!!! this area was such a disaster no weeds even grew here before. this is the area from the pictures above, the old ash landfill. you can see the little hill i made where all the ash is. Logs say that a volume of around 7-8 full size dump trucks of ash was dumped here from my incinerator operations between 2022-2024.

its just so good because like when i cleaned up some of my other dumping grounds in 2022 i could never get grass to grow because i admittedly did a pretty shotty job but this time I took a whole month and followed  the remediation methods used within the EPA's CERCLA process and was really able to turn things around here so im very happy, and my parents are too that we no longer have a 3000 square foot coal ash landfill in our backyard.

So my company recently released lots of images and information about the production of fluorochemicals. I published many images of rare chemicals such as Liquid hexafluoropropylene, Freon 22, PFOA, and dimethicone to wikipedia and released information about the production of Propylene 150. This declassification of media is one of the largest ones i've ever done and provides images of compounds such as Hexafluoropropylene and PFOA which have zero pictures of them whatsoever on the internet. https://pfas.fluorchem.ca/home

Nah it‚Äôs different, let me explain then, like generally like if u like a girl u get to know her friends too so like with the one girl I like we go do things with just us like get dinner or go on a walk etc, but like when there all together I‚Äôll do things like walk them back to their rooms or distract someone they don‚Äôt wanna talk to etc. All her friends like me aswell right but like obviously none of her friends are gonna try and date me bc she‚Äôd be going after someone her friend likes so it‚Äôs like super mean no one would do that to their friends yk.

honestly walking into my chemical plant makes me sad af because its a whole different life im no longer living üò≠  i mean i'm def happier than ever overall bc like I literally have everything you could ever need in life but like i jus miss running my factory. because sure at university like you can drink and smoke or fuck all the girls you want, but in the real world no one cares, you matter just as little. operating a factory and manufacturing product that's sold across the world, being one of the largest bleach sellers on amazon,  making more money than peoples living wages, all while being a kid and having a company before I even graduated high school is what matters, putting money in the bank.

ya plan b metabolization process places a load on the liver and since alot of the chemicals used in manufacturing processes here are very hepatoxic, it would have a synergistic toxic effect causing inflammation, oxidative damage, hepatic tumors and a whole bunch of other bad things.

Nah I get it as a cottage area but I could never live there. Not for me, absolutely nothing going on. I‚Äôve already been fighting my town on environmental rules I can only imagine what rules and conservation they got going on there. Would not be able to have a business there

[10/13/2024 8:58 PM] carbon.tetrachloride
It‚Äôs different tho like I‚Äôm not thinking personally it‚Äôs just as a factory owner right I just see some pieces of real estate differently for work purposes, just like a developer would see a field and think about how a subdivision would work there, I think about how a factory would work there.

[10/13/2024 9:02 PM] the_baller47
Cause it makes you appreciate how much easier life is a little bit more, it‚Äôs nice being a bit disconnected and not having so many things to worry about and be stupid and just enjoy life with friends.
